This research proposes a complete framework for UAVs path planning integrating the advancement of computer vision and optimization. This system focuses on multi-objectives which is initialized with the edge detection from aerial land images. An holistic edge detection model is proposed with color segmentation helps to extract the relevant areas for inspection. Area decomposition method helps to generate a flexible path for traversal. Finally, the modified simulated annealing algorithm with grid search optimization determine the shortest route to cover the whole area.
